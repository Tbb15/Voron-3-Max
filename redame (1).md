Hi I’m Tomer, a maker from Israel.  
my making journey started 2.5 years ago with a Creality Ender 3 Max, it had a lot of problems throughout the years, it’s slow and not precise but im not ready to give up on her mainly because of the build volume 300x300x350 which will be 300x300x380 with the upgrades I’m gonna put on her  
About a year ago I bought a Flashforge Adventurer 5m which is amazing but a little small.  
I find myself often cutting up parts or need to make things 80% of the original size,  
this will change with the **Voron ender**

My goal is to make a voron trident like printer based on the ender 3 max but core xy that will be precise and fast
