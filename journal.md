The Voron Ender  
By Tomer Barash Biram  
A fast and accurate Creality Ender 3 Max    
Created between 12/6/25-15/07/25

**Total Time Spent about 77 hours**

Day 1: I tried to use the 4040 extrusions of the existing printer for the frame and started to design the frame   
**3 hours**

Day 2: I designed the x gantry and tried to design a cartesian motion system like the ender 5 Also, I redesigned the frame to fit the 300x300 build volume using printed extensions to the 4040 extrusions.  
**7 hours**

Day 3: I wanted to use more 2020 extrusions instead of the 4040 because the 4040 is more expensive so I redesigned the frame again also started to design a core xy system  
**5 hours**

Day 4: I continued to design the core xy system  
**6 hours**

Day 5: I updated the frame like this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wqTiJUHX-Q&list=PLjmTDKK12D4LFwWOvKoHKerZ8iyAbqlaU&index=1) and continued the core xy system  
Note: it was really frustrating so i thought about going cartesian or even bed slinger\!  
But a good one like the lh stinger  
**8 hours**

Day 6: I took the voron trident gantry and made mods   
**6 hours**

Day 7: I made a bed holder and bracket and changed the frame  to use less extrusions  
**4 hours**

Day 8: I finished most of the CAD and started the bom  
Note: I thought that what’s left to model is the electronic boxes for the btt pi and the skr mini e3 v3   
**2 hours**

Day 9: I thought I finished all the CAD and the BOM.  
the BOM was a little high (I thought 262$ then was high LOL ) so I thought about ways to lower the price by using linear rods on the z axis but to model it would take me about 2 days so i ditched the idea  
**5 hours**

Day 10: I continued the BOM and fixed a few issues with the CAD

Day 11:I finished the BOM removed 2 linear rails to make the project 350$ and I also digitalised the journal from my notebook right now Im uploading the project to github
right before i uploaded the project my gut told me to call my friend yoav which is also a cad guy from my robotics (FTC) team
after i talked to yoav i saw major flaws in my design so i started a redsign
**6 hours**  

Day 12: although I started the redesign yesterday I’m in the finishing stages because of this 2 things:  
1 checking everything, even the smallest things like screws, nuts etc.  
2 not delaying tasks.  
The printer looks already like one With linear rods on the z axis  
**6 hours**

Day 13: I installed extrusion brackets and standardise the screws  
Also I designed screws for the linear bearing bracket  
**2.5 hours**

Day 14: My laptop is working slow, I only had an hour to work on the project because tomorrow I’m going to the Netherlands for the FTC European premier event with my team Megiddo Lions \#18833.  
Any way I have only fixed small issues with the screw joints  
**1 hour**

Day 15: I returned yesterday from the Netherlands. We were placed 10th and were head of alliance 7 in the playoffs.  
I added a few screws and t nuts and was ready to start the BOM and then disaster stroke the gantry wasn't sitting right on the frame and I couldn't so I started a new redesign  
**2 hours**

Day 16: I figured out what was the problem but it was too late so I continued the redesign I finished the frame and the gantry  
**3 hours**

Day 17: I have put the bed assembly, the linear rods and the lead screws  
**2.5 hours**

Day 18: I finished the final design I have a BOM left to do  
**5 hours**

Day 19: I started the BOM and tweaked a little things like screws and nuts  
**2 hours**

Day 20: I almost finished the BOM which I needed to cheap on a little  
**3 hours**

Day 21: I finished the BOM and put the last 4 screws   
I joined slack And synced the journal from the note book to the google docs  
Finished the journal  
Started a repository  
And submitted the project  
**6 hours**
Day 22: I changed a little the readme and journal
**2 hours**
